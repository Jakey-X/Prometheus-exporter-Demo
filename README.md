# Prometheus-exporter-Demo
This is a simple Demo of Prometheus exporter, which can provide a metrics called "just_a_test" with the cpu utilization rate of running machine 

## Something I have to say
This is just a simple exporter implemented in Go, and it is very simple to run, just execute `go run .` in the directory That is, the purpose of this small exporter is mainly to let the initial do not understand how to customize the exporter of the newcomers can also be written to understand the logic (not the internal implementation of the logic hhh)

Feel free to modify this code to start your custom exporter journey!
